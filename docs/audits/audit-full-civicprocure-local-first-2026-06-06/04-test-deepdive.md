# Test Deep Dive

## Scope

Reviewed behavioral tests, old-assumption replacements, release verifier, and walkthrough evidence.

## Severity Rollup

- Blocker: 0
- Critical: 0
- Major: 0
- Minor: 0
- Nit: 0

## Findings

No findings.

## What's Working

- Tests now fail if default local readiness falls back to not-ready/no-DB behavior.
- Tests prove default staff queue persistence, persisted RFP and award IDs, staff auth gating, staff UI route, no `innerHTML` sink, and integration contract names.
- `tests/conftest.py` isolates default runtime data per test to avoid checkout pollution.
- `bash scripts/verify-release.sh` passed after the implementation and docs updates.

## Residual Risk

Clean-machine suite integration must prove the installer env, launcher, staff-keyed queue read, and all ten module routes together.
