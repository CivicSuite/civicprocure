# Engineering Deep Dive

## Scope

Reviewed `civicprocure/main.py`, persistence behavior, staff auth boundaries, integration contracts, tests, and release verification.

## Severity Rollup

- Blocker: 0
- Critical: 0
- Major: 0
- Minor: 0
- Nit: 0

## Findings

No findings.

## What's Working

- Default persistence uses `CIVICPROCURE_DATA_DIR` and falls back to a local SQLite file, while explicit `CIVICPROCURE_WORKPAPER_DB_URL` remains supported.
- RFP draft and award-packet flows now persist IDs and create staff review queue items in the default no-env path.
- Integration contracts are machine-readable and stable for suite verification.

## Residual Risk

The suite installer must set an isolated data directory and staff key before clean-machine proof. This is an umbrella integration task, not a module defect.
